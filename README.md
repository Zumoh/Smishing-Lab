# Smishing-Lab
This repository documents an investigation into a recent smishing (text-based phishing) attempt. It uncovers the tactics and tools used by threat actors to deceive users. Explore a detailed analysis and the key findings.

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Threat Identification:
   - Recognizing signs of smishing, such as unsolicited messages, urgency, poor grammar, and suspicious links.
- Analytical Skills:
   - Using tools like VirusTotal, Cisco Talos, AnyRun, WHOIS, and URLscan.io to analyze and interpret data.
   - Understanding and correlating information across multiple cybersecurity tools.
- Dynamic Malware Analysis:
   - Running and observing the behavior of suspicious links and files in a sandbox environment (AnyRun).
   - Interpreting reports on activities, network connections, file modifications, and processes.
- IP Reputation and Domain Analysis:
   - Checking the reputation of IP addresses and domains using services like Cisco Talos and WHOIS.
   - Understanding how domain registration and timing can indicate malicious intent.
- Forensic Reporting:
   - Documenting findings clearly and concisely.
   - Creating detailed reports on analysis and conclusions.
- Preventive Measures:
   - Learning how to identify and avoid potential phishing threats.
   - Advising on actions to take when encountering suspicious messages or links.

### Tools Used

- VirusTotal: To scan link found in the text message.
- Cisco Talos: To evaluate the safety and reputation of IP addresses associated with the url.
- AnyRun: To Execute and analyze the links in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.
- Whois: To acertain ownership details of the domain found in the link.
- URLscan.io: To analyzes the URL to identify its behavior and potential risks.

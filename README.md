# Smishing-Lab
This repository documents an investigation into a recent smishing (text-based phishing) attempt. It uncovers the tactics and tools used by threat actors to deceive users. Explore a detailed analysis and the key findings.

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Threat Identification:
   - Recognizing signs of smishing, such as unsolicited messages, urgency, poor grammar, and suspicious links.
- Analytical Skills:
   - Using tools like VirusTotal, Cisco Talos, AnyRun, WHOIS, and URLscan.io to analyze and interpret data.
   - Understanding and correlating information across multiple cybersecurity tools.
- Dynamic Malware Analysis:
   - Running and observing the behavior of suspicious links and files in a sandbox environment (AnyRun).
   - Interpreting reports on activities, network connections, file modifications, and processes.
- IP Reputation and Domain Analysis:
   - Checking the reputation of IP addresses and domains using services like Cisco Talos and WHOIS.
   - Understanding how domain registration and timing can indicate malicious intent.
- Forensic Reporting:
   - Documenting findings clearly and concisely.
   - Creating detailed reports on analysis and conclusions.
- Preventive Measures:
   - Learning how to identify and avoid potential phishing threats.
   - Advising on actions to take when encountering suspicious messages or links.

### Tools Used

- VirusTotal: Scans links and files with multiple antivirus programs to detect malicious activity.
- Cisco Talos: Evaluates the safety and reputation of IP addresses and websites.
- AnyRun: Executes and analyzes suspicious files and links in a controlled environment to observe their behavior.
- Whois: Provides ownership details of domain names and IP addresses.
- URLscan.io: Analyzes websites and URLs to identify their behavior and potential risks.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
